Installation
============

Python version
--------------

DeepQMC is compatible with Python 3.7 and higher.

Dependencies
------------

These packages will be installed automatically when installing DeepQMC.

- `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ is an essential library for numerical computation in Python.
- `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ is one of the most popular Python frameworks for deep learning.
- `TOML <https://github.com/uiri/toml>`_ implements the `TOML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML>`__ configuration file format in Python.
- `uncertainties <http://uncertainties-python-package.readthedocs.io>`_ helps with propagation of uncertainties in calculations.

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are required only by non-essential parts of DeepQMC and their installation must be requested explicitly, as documented below.

- `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_ provides essential numerical algorithms.
- `PySCF <http://pyscf.org>`_ implements quantum chemistry methods in Python. This is used to obtain the HF orbitals.
- `Tensorboard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`_ is a practical tool for monitoring training of neural networks.
- `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/>`_ is used by Tensorboard to store pictures in the event files.
- `TQDM <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`_ provides progress bars.
- `h5py <https://www.h5py.org>`_ handles IO for `HDF5 <http://hdfgroup.org>`_ files.
- `Click <https://click.palletsprojects.com>`_ helps with constructing command-line interfaces.
- `TOML Kit <https://github.com/sdispater/tomlkit>`_ supports advanced TOML file manipulations.

Virtual environments
--------------------

It is a good practice to separate the dependencies of different Python projects with the use of virtual environments::

   $ mkdir myproject
   $ cd myproject
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate

This code creates a virtual environment in the ``venv`` directory and actives it. As a result, the ``python`` and ``pip`` executables available in the shell are now in the ``venv/bin`` directory, and any package and its dependencies are installed locally.

Install DeepQMC
---------------

Within the activated virtual environment, DeepQMC can be installed with::

    $ pip install -U deepqmc

To install all optional dependencies, use::

    $ pip install -U deepqmc[wf,train,cli]

Developing
----------

To install DeepQMC from a local Git repository, use `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_::

    $ git clone https://github.com/deepqmc/deepqmc
    $ cd deepqmc
    $ poetry install -E all

In addition to all the optional dependencies above, this also installs `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_ and `Coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io>`_.
