API
=======

This is the documentation of the API of the JAX implementation of the :class:`deepqmc` package.

This implementation uses the `JAX library <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, the documentation for which can be found here:

- `JAX documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

.. automodule:: deepqmc
   :exclude-members: train, MolecularHamiltonian, DecorrSampler, MetropolisSampler, ResampledSampler

.. automodule:: deepqmc.hamil

Haiku
-----

The JAX implementation uses the `haiku library <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_ to create, train and evaluate neural network models.
Some additional neural network functionality is implemented in the package and documented here.

.. automodule:: deepqmc.hkext

Training and evaluation
-----------------------

.. automodule:: deepqmc.train

.. automodule:: deepqmc.fit

Sampling
--------

.. autoclass:: deepqmc.sampling.Sampler

.. automodule:: deepqmc.sampling

Wave functions
--------------

.. autoclass:: deepqmc.wf.WaveFunction

.. autoclass:: deepqmc.wf.NeuralNetworkWaveFunction

.. automodule:: deepqmc.wf.nn_wave_function.nn_wave_function
   :exclude-members: NeuralNetworkWaveFunction

Graph neural networks
---------------------

A graph neural network is the most important component of the neural network wave function ansatz.
This module implements a general gnn framework, that can be configured to obtain a variety of different ansatzes.

Graphs
~~~~~~

This submodule implements the basic functionality for working with graphs.

.. automodule:: deepqmc.gnn.graph

.. automodule:: deepqmc.gnn.edge_features

ElectronGNN
~~~~~~~~~~~

This submodule provides the ElectronGNN architecture for defining neural network
parametrized functions acting on graphs of electrons and nuclei.

.. automodule:: deepqmc.gnn.electron_gnn
