Welcome to DeepQMC
==================

Welcome to the DeepQMC documentation. Start with :ref:`installation <installation>` and then go through the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`, which walks you through the basic usage of the package. Detailed technical reference can be found in the :ref:`api <api>` section. Finally, most of the functionality is accessible via the :ref:`cli <cli>`.

DeepQMC is based on `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ and `Haiku <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_, the documentation for which can be found here:

- `JAX documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_
- `Haiku documentation <https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

For an introduction to the methodology of variational Monte Carlo with neural network trial wave functions, details on the deep-learning Ansätze and applications of the DeepQMC program package we refer to the accompanying `software paper <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0157512>`_.
